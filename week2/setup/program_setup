1.Prep your PC’s network
  – Open Windows Network Settings → Change adapter options → right-click your Ethernet interface → Properties → IPv4.
  – Set a static IP in the same subnet you’ll use on the LOGO! (e.g. PC = 192.168.0.10, Subnet Mask = 255.255.255.0).

2.Read or assign the LOGO!8 IP
  – In LOGOSoft, switch to Network View and click Get (or Set) LOGO!8 IP. This pulls in or lets you type the IP address for your LOGO! module 


3.Add the LOGO! device into your project
  – Still in Network View, click Add New Device, choose LOGO! 8_3_1, and enter the module’s IP, its serial number (SN), and gateway (if you’ve got one) 


4.Download your project to the LOGO!
  – Go to Tools → Transfer → PC to LOGO8, type in the LOGO! IP address you set earlier, then hit OK to push your program down to the module 


5.Switch your LOGO! into Run mode
  – After the transfer finishes, click the little RUN toggle in Soft Comfort (or right-click the device and pick Run Mode) to let it start executing your logic 


6.Physically hook up your PC and LOGO!
  – Plug an Ethernet cable between your PC’s NIC and the LOGO!’s RJ-45 port (a crossover cable isn’t needed with most modern NICs). Look for the LNK/ACT LEDs to light up.

7.Verify the link
  – Open a command prompt and run ping <LOGO_IP> (e.g., ping 192.168.0.20). If you see replies, you’re all set!
